"To use both the Parh and Files classes, use the following statement.
import.java.nio.file.*"
"To create and define a path, use the Paths class and its get() method.
Ex: Path filePath = Paths.get("C:\\Java\\Chapter\\sample.text")"

Absolute path - complete path.
"it does not require any other information to locate a file on a system.
Ex: C:\Java\Chapter\sample.txt"

Relative path - depends on other path information.
Ex: sample.txt
    Chapter8\sample.txt
    Java\Chapter8
